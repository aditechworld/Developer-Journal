### **What is Database Replication?**

Database replication is the process of copying and maintaining database objects, such as tables and records, in multiple database systems. It ensures that data is consistent and synchronized across different locations or servers. The primary purpose of replication is to improve database availability, enhance performance, and provide disaster recovery.

### **Benefits of Database Replication:**

1. **High Availability:** Ensures data is accessible even if one database server fails.
2. **Scalability:** Enables distributed read operations across multiple servers to handle higher loads.
3. **Disaster Recovery:** Provides a backup copy of the database for recovery purposes.
4. **Data Localization:** Replicates data closer to the user or region for faster access.
